# 🏏 IPL 2022 Data Analysis Project
### *Uncovering Trends and Insights from the 15th Season of IPL*

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 season. Using Python, I analyzed match results, venue performance, toss decisions, and player statistics to understand the key factors that influenced the tournament's outcome.

## 🚀 Key Insights from the Analysis
* **Most Successful Team:** **Gujarat Titans** dominated the season with **12 wins**.
* **Toss Strategy:** A majority of teams (around 80%) preferred **Fielding First**, showing a strong trend toward chasing targets.
* **Player Brilliance:** Identified top individual performances, including high-impact innings and lethal bowling spells like **Jasprit Bumrah’s 5/10**.
* **Venue Impact:** Analysis shows how scores varied across different stadiums in Mumbai and Pune.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Data Manipulation:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- **Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📁 Repository Structure
